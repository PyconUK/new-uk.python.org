The UKPA maintains a node on the [Matrix network](https://matrix.org/).

To connect with us, you can either follow this [invitation link](https://matrix.to/#/!PxQLUASvEmbvzsdrmS:uk.python.org?via=matrix.org) or:

1. Choose a [matrix client](https://matrix.org/clients/). Element is the best known and has desktop, mobile and browser versions.
2. Register an account on a matrix node. matrix.org is the best known open node but there are [many others](https://www.hello-matrix.net/public_servers.php).
3. Join our main room. Its address is #community:uk.python.org

Alternatively, you can [contact the trustees via email](mailto:trustees@uk.python.org).
